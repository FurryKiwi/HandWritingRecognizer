# HandWritingRecognizer

A simple Convolution Neural Network that I trained on my own writing of digits. Through augmentation I was able to grow the 15000 images to around 200-300k I believe. The model performs decently well on others handwriting of digits but it hasn't been fully tested.
The program lets you set your own crop points for grabbing the digit areas from scanned documents. All built off of Tkinter.

Not fully completed and I don't think I'll get around to finishing it. Figured I'd put it up on here to see if it can help someone else learn.
